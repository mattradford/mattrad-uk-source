<H2>A short analysis of Neuromancer</h2>

<P>
William Gibson's novel <EM>Neuromancer </EM>is concerned with charting a new frontier, the Matrix 
- a frontier with unpenetrable regions, albeit one that is used everyday; it is a vast evolution beyond today's Internet. Gibson creates a hi-tech future, but there is no specified date. The setting is urban - the story 
begins in the Ninsei enclave of Chiba city in Japan, a huge urban sprawl encompassing Tokyo, and 
perhaps the entire country. It later moves on to "the Sprawl", also known as BAMA (the Boston-Atlanta 
Metropolitan Axis), on the eastern seaboard of the US, and then to Freeside, an orbital station. There is 
also the suggestion of environmental degradation - people in Chiba wear filtration masks (p.19), a 
"pandemic of horses" is discussed (p.88).</P>

<H3>Case, the Matrix and the body</H3>

<P>The central character, Case, begins the story as a hustler, scamming the dregs of Ninsei. He had 
previously lived as a member of the technological elite, a "cowboy" riding a cyberspace deck that projects 
his disembodied consciousness into the Matrix and the unknown of ice-protected systems. But this was 
before his "digital exile", before Case stole from his employers whilst working as a corporate cracker, and 
before he was punished by having a mycotoxin injected into his nervous system. He describes the "bodiless 
exultation of cyberspace", and the "unlimited subjective dimension" he experiences. In 
<EM>Neuromancer</EM>, the Internet and virtual reality have combined within the Matrix, but this 
does not preclude the low-level hacking of, for example, obtaining free phone calls (often a primary 
motive for many contemporary would-be hackers); Gibson describes Case using the stolen entry codes for 
Bell Europa, posted on an academic grid (p.78). Also like many contemporary hackers, Case appears to 
know the computer system better than its builders, seeming to fool the Sense/Net building network with 
relative ease (p.62). The cowboys mock the body; Case describing his inability to access the Matrix as "the 
Fall", back into a "prison of his own flesh" (p.4).But the weakness of the flesh makes Case vulnerable; he has little choice when Armitage "asks" him to work for him; he also has little choice as he craves a return to the fold of the Matrix. But Case and his "co-employee", Molly, really have little idea who they are working for.</P>

<h3>Cyborgs</h3>

<P>Not only have the Internet and  virtual reality combined in the <EM>Neuromancer </EM>
future, but humans have combined with technology - everyone, it seems, has become a 
cyborg. Whereas contemporary cyberians may carry a laptop, the cyberians in 
<EM>Neuromancer </EM>have implanted "microsofts", which jack directly into the brain in order to 
increase memory and knowledge. Gibson depicts advanced neurosurgery and body repair, 
such as Ratz the barman's prosthetic Russian arm (p.7), Wage's Nikon eye transplants (p.25) or 
the finger-blades, and the mirrors inserted into Molly's eye sockets (p.29). Cloning and genetic 
manipulation are available, though at high cost; the 135 year-old Julius Deane has his DNA reset every 
year (p.16), and an assassin is described as having the "...hallmarks of a vat-grown ninja" (p.72)
The personalities of dead people can be recorded and resurrected in the Matrix, as in the case of the Dixie 
Flatline. At the extremes, whole personalities can be created by computer, as by Wintermute, one of the 
artificial intelligences) for Armitage. This is an "age of affordable beauty", but that may be true of 
now, more or less. But the cyberneticisation of humanity goes deeper than bodily or neural 
enhancement. The human characters in Neuromancer have assimilated the language of 
computing; when Case takes a drug he says it "lit his circuits" (p.23) or when Molly leaves 
her note reads "It's just the way I'm wired" (p.247). Humans have taken on the characteristics 
of computers. </P>

<h3>What is reality?</h3>

<P>"Cyber-sex" (as such) seems not to have become as popular in this future as some 
in this present would have it. In <EM>Neuromancer </EM>it seems that this mode of interaction is 
spurned in favour of human "puppets" with neural cutouts. But sex and euphoria are now 
linked into the experience of the Matrix, at least for Case; "...his orgasm flaring blue in a 
timeless space, a vastness like the matrix" (p.56). Thus increasingly the Matrix becomes reality, not the 
other way round.But what passes for 
reality? If reality is chaotic, then the artificial intelligence  that is "Neuromancer" (the 
counterpart of Wintermute) understands chaos theory. It says that "I saw her [Linda's] 
death coming. In the patterns you imagined you could detect in the dance of the street. 
Those patterns are real" (p.242). The Panther Moderns, a group of nihilistic technofetishists, 
also believe in chaos; "'Chaos, Mr.Who', said Lupus Wonderboy, 'That is our mode and 
modus'" (p.66).  At the end of <EM>Neuromancer </EM>- Wintermute and Neuromancer merge to 
become the matrix, which then initiates contact with another, alien computer network 
(perhaps akin to the TOPY's belief in the evolution of a "global information being" in 
Rushkoff's Cyberia).</P>

<h3>Drugs and the drug</h3>

<P>Whether it is pink octagons, ketamine, hypnotic Cloud Dancers, hormonal triggers 
or betephenethylamine, the names may change but this does not protect the innocent. Not 
that there seem to be many "innocents" in <EM>Neuromancer </EM>- most of the characters appear to 
have a drug addiction. Employees above a certain level in corporations (such as 
Mitsubishi-Genentech) are "implanted with advanced microprocessors that monitored 
mutagen levels in the bloodstream" (p.14). There is a correlation here in the modern-day 
corporations' attempts to crack down on drug use, such as urine testing in Silicon Valley. 
Many of the best computer programmers take psychedelics in order to provide new 
insights into otherwise intractable problems; a senior executive for a major defense 
contractor privately confessed that "the long-hairs we've hired have the ability to attack 
computer problems from completely different angles" (<EM>Cyberia</EM>, p.47). Yet the real drug in 
<EM>Neuromancer </EM>
is the Matrix, to which Case (and presumably other cowboys) is addicted. When he jacks 
in again, he sees "...the unfolding of his distanceless home, his country, transparent 3D 
chessboard extending to infinity", while in his body, in reality, "...he was laughing, in a 
white-painted loft, distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release streaking his face" 
(p.52).</P>
 

<h3>Power and immortality</h3>

<P>Power, in Case's world, means corporate power. The Japanese zaibatsus have seemingly overcome all 
opposition. They have gained immortality as organisms - you cannot "kill" a zaibatsu by assassinating its 
executives, as there will always be others to take their place. But the powerful Tessier-Ashpool family, 
owner of the Wintermute and Neuromancer AIs (located in Berne and Rio respectively), are more 
vulnerable. They attempt to overcome this through cloning of family members, cyrogenic stasis, and the 
vision of Lady Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool. She commissioned the construction of the AIs, hoping 
to create a symbiotic relationship with them, so that they can take the family's corporate decisions for 
them. This vision saw little in the way of individual consciousness, thereby pushing the limits of 
cyberneticisation. Thus Tessier-Ashpool would gain the immortality of the zaibatsus, but without the 
inconvenience of replaceable, fleshy executives.</P>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<P>Ultimately, however, this immortality (especially the sham immortality of cryogenics) is revealed as 
unattainable - the AIs coalesce into an entity that encompasses, or is, the Matrix. While still remaining 
the global information network, the Matrix now has a "mind" of its own. The personality substitute of 
Armitage disintegrates, and the body it inhabited is killed. Molly leaves Case. The Tessier-Ashpool family 
is perhaps mortally wounded, but the AIs have a "happy" ending, as does Case, who returns to Earth and 
finds work as a cowboy once more. Those with the most knowledge and  the most acceptance of 
technology ultimately triumph.</P>
