<p>Providing the world's most attractive GUI with stunning multimedia fanfares will not give the system a good "feel" if the processor grinds slowly to a halt under the sheer task load. Countless games have been written that demanded too much of the hardware they were designed for. "The Lord of the Rings" was a textually based adventure/strategy game with occasional graphics for the 8-bit Micros of the 1980's. Some user inputs required a 5 minute process cycle before another chance of interaction was given. The response time felt slow, sloppy and annoying. This created an informally assimilated program specification beyond the designer's immediate thoughts.

<p>If a user is required to wait they should be kept informed of system activities. A blank screen with no information leaves a user wondering what has happened - has the system simply crashed? An icon of an egg timer is one famous solution, another is the InstallShield-style task bar that gives an indication of  the percentage of the task remaining until completion. Indeed, for a product to carry the "Microsoft Windows 95/98 compatible" badge, one of the requirements is the percentage task bar. In any case, users feel that waiting time is actually less when such confirmation is employed, despite evidence to the contrary.
