<p>Games players of varying experience will no doubt expect different levels of difficulty from a game. What may seem an elementary level of playability to the program designers may seem far too difficult to a novice computer user/game player. Games design should offer something for everyone whatever their experience level. For instance, "<a href="http://www.dlc.fi/~hlp/emu/reviews/snes/dkc1.htm" target="top">Donkey Kong 2</a>" on the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Bunker/4544" target="top">Super Nintendo</a>, informs the user of the percentage of total game area completed at the end, encouraging mastery. Unlike non-game environments where the user must be in charge, seeing the computer as a tool to ease a task, a games player is not always in charge, as the difficulty of the game dictates.
