<h3><u>Chill Out</U></h3><br>

I took time out to recover from 2 days of exertion, and cleaned myself up. It also happened to be Northern Territory Day, as well as Canada Day. As a result of the former, seemingly most of Darwin's population was to be found that evening down on Mindil beach, where there was a night market and an amphitheatre with a classical orchestra playing. There were some truly spectacular fireworks, even better than the ones I saw last time at <a href="http://www.jraskin.com/shirt.htm">Disneyworld</a>. But then that was 10 years or so ago.
