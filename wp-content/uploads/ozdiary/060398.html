<h3><u>Laters Norwich - Friday 6th March</u></h3><br>

The Forrest, the York, the Ghost Face and the mattrad. Made it up for the last hurrah of the latter.<br><br>

And lo, it was large<br><br>

A fine piss up was had in the bar, followed by further wastedness at the Swan House. Good venue as usual. And I think Al was feeling a bit tender the next day (tough shit, stokie!)<br><br>

Also cheers to all the posse who came out for the farewell meal at Bella Pasta the next day. It was superb, and a fine way to round off the weekend.<br><br>

Though going to retro would have been better! I have a feeling that much drunkeness was had, and many damsels were abused by the Stoke Two. Nice one fellas.<br><br>
