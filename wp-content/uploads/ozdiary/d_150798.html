<h3><u>Heavy Tasting</U></h3><br>

July 14th - Bastille Day, with over a million people celebrating on the Champs-Elysees, and no doubt a similar number at home for Dad's birthday. Appropriately enough, though, I spent the day in the <a href="http://secure.mtx.net.au/~kaesler/welcome.html">Barossa Valley</a>, South Australia, one of the country's premier wine-producing regions. Iain and I travelled up in his green monster of a car for an afternoon of tasting (not without a  near burst tyre and an emergency stop at the garage).<br><br>

We arrived at about 1 in the aftrenoon, and checked into the Bunkhaus, in Nuriootpa, and set off on our hired bikes to check out some wineries. The first stop was the world-famous <a href="http://www.penfolds.com.au">Penfolds</a> winery, then we managed to get round about 6 others by 5 o'clock. Including Stanley Brother's, whose motto was: "Life's too short to drink bad wine"!! Top stuff. We then retired to the hostel with a couple of bottles of plonk, where we gorged on pizza in front of the real wood fire. Great stuff.<br><br>

Next day we headed back after making some choice purchases, and in the evening I met up with Carl and Kerry whom I used to work with at Sprowston Manor in Norwich. They took me out for a fine dinner in North Adelaide, and paid the bill. Couldn't complain!
