<h3><u>Ermm...</U></h3><br>

Not much doing at the moment; working on the tan, contemplating going for a surf lesson, that's about all. Bec quit her job at the pub (after 1 day), when the owner told her she'd be working a whole week "on trial" = no pay! Rightfully, she told him to stick it, then went and scored another job the next day, waitressing at a nearby Italian restaurant called Toscani's. Si bella signorita.<br><br>

Met a bloke from Lyminge, which is about 3 or 4 miles from Hythe. Weird.
