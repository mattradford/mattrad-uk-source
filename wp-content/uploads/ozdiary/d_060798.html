<h3><u>20 hours back on the Greyhound</U></h3><br>

From Darwin to Alice Springs was a mere 20 hours/1500 kms with one major town - Katherine - and nothing much else in between. Except for Daly Waters, a township we stopped off at for 5 minutes, which was 10 kms off the Stuart Highway. Had a great looking pub there, and it was the location of Australia's most remote traffic light. It was on red.<br><br>

Also saw a sign on arrival in Alice Springs saying "London - 15030 km".
