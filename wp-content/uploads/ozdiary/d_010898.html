<h3><u>The Federal Suburb</U></h3><br>

Canberra, meaning meeting place, the centre of the Commonwealth of Australia's <a href="http://www.fed.gov.au.">federal government</a>. Fifty kilometres from side to side, nearly all of which is suburbs. And a good metaphor for Oz itself, which seems to be comprised, in the populated areas, of a strange suburban mass. Which I decided to travers by bike. So, I walked up to the <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au">Australian National University</a>, where I hired a bike for the day (well, the half day as I'm still no early riser) for the pricely sum of $10, no deposit required. Before taking the bike, I took advantage of the comveniences, and saw the following graffitti on the door of one of the loos:<br><br>

"Student Politicians Eat Shit", followed by:<br>
"Until they become real politicians, by which time they're full of it"!<br><br>

I almost pissed myself, handy comnsidering where I was sitting! But this was itself followed by a small comment underneath:<br><br>

"I'll vote for anyone who eats mine!", which topped it off nicely.<br><br>

I cycled up to the Federal Parliament (as shown below looking pretty stunning), not too far away but far too tiring, just in time to catch a tour around the building, which was very good. For some strange reason, though, I couldn't take my Swiss Army knife in. As if I was going to knife any ministers just for laughs! Hmmmm.....<br><br>

Then I cycled off to the National Gallery, saw a great modern art exhibition and some Japanese Edo-era art work, then cycled back to the uni, just in time to get the bike back.<br><br>

And now I'm in Bateman's Bay, Batehaven to be precise, staying with my relatives, Dad's cousin Shirley and her husband Alan, and very nice they are too!
