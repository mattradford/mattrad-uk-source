<h3><u>Mullum</U></h3><br>

Today we travelled up to Mullumbimby, not far up the coast; it's like Byron, except without the tourists. I was in the market for a jumper, having left mine on a bus somewhere up north. Small little town, not much there. Saw a jumper, but I didn't have my fashion consultant (Bec) with me so I wasn't sure.<br><br>

We all went out for a meal in the evening to Fresh, a superb little restaurant at the top of Byron town. All of us being:<br><br>
Jeff and Sandra, their daughter Jacinta, Kelly (scouser), Beatrice (from Switzerland), Tim, Bec, Sonia (italia) and her bloke Ken (Oz), Paul from north London, and representing Japan, Wakato and Tomomi.<br><br>

And all of which was paid for by Jeff and Sandra - can't complain! I had a wicked Seafood Marinara, and watched everyone else get drunk. I still haven't had any booze, even though we went to two pubs afterwards. This gave Wakato a chance to perve over one of the very attractive barmaids at the Beach Hotel (part-owned by Paul Hogan and run by 8 brothers); I may have joined in myself for a bit :)
