<h3><u>The beach (party)</U></h3><br>

Went to a market in nearby Bangalow, then spent the rest of the day working on Jeff's web site. Except that I got plastered at a beach party; 15 of us tried to leg it in over the back to avoid paying. Most of us got caught, but the guy who caught us was sao relaxed he apologised about it! That's how chilled out this place is.<br><br>

Apart from some of the Brits. Upper-class dickheads almost started a puch-up outside the pie shop at 3am. But when the guys from Bristol we were with offered them out they bricked it and ran away. Har-de-har-har!
