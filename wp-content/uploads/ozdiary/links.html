<br><h3><u>Aussie links</u></h3>
(A  none  too pretty catalogue of where  I've  been, where  I may  go, gutters slept in, etc.)<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Essential info from those with the beds.....
<a href="http://www.yha.org.au"><img src="yhaoz.gif" align=center alt="yha australia" border=0></a><br><br>

<li>A Californian who made the journey - Melissa's <a href="../../Athens/Delphi/1839/travel.html">Aussie Trip.</a><br><br>

<li>Art or a bunch of old toss? You decide for yourselves at the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/8964/msaams.html">Young Australian's Poetry Page</a><br><br>

<li>Australia's most visible racist - an <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/9766">anti-Pauline Hanson page</a>. Hey, if I wasn't such a pacifist i'd shoot her myself.</ul><br><br>

<h4><u>New South Wales</u></h4>
<ul>
<li>I stayed here at <a href="http://www.yha.org.au/central.html">Sydney Central</a> on the first few nights. A bit like a hotel, really, and you didn't get to meet many people. Talk to Nadine behind the desk if you go, though, as she's cool as.<br><br>
<li>A very fine place to chill out, <a href="http://rainboweb.com/byron.htm">Byron Bay.</a> Much new age business going on.<br><br>

<li>Finally I got it uploaded - my first attempt at professional web design, for <a href="http://www.lis.net.au/~jsbay">Js Bay YHA Hostel</a>.<br><br>

<li>A collection of Australia's BIG THINGS, including a shot of Nimbin, courtesy of the <a href="http://www.acs.org.au/president/1996/atm/travel/sydnmb/welcome.html">High-Tech Tourist</a>.

<br><br>
<h4><u>Queensland</u></h4>

<ul>
<li>Capital of QLD - <a href="http://www.acs.org.au/president/1996/atm/travel/sydnmb/welcome.html"> Brisbane</a>.
