<h3><u>Osaka? You sucka - Monday 9th March</u></h3><br>

Six hours. Six hours of stopover at Kansai airport, in Osaka, Japan. Six hours of praying down to the immoblie god, the Toshiba tv in the middle of the waiting lounge. Six hours of watching tv that was basically incomprehensible, even to the Japanese (except that there was a bit of an upset in the sumo, when fat bloater #1 unexpectedley did over lard arse #2).<br><br>

But it was widescreen, so it was good.<br>
