<h3><u>On the road again</U></h3><br>

Had to leg it down to the bus station after getting a bit too engrossed in something on tv, making it just in time. Sat next to  a bloke from Sheffield on the bus, who'd been annoyed by the people in his room, so he'd nicked one shoelace from each of their shoes. What a tosser! Anyway, I ignored this bloke and read all the way down to <a href="http://www.ozramp.net.au/~senani/coober.htm">Coober Pedy</a>, and opal mining settlement in South Australia where most of the people live underground. As was the hostel, Radeka's, that I stayed in.<br><br>

I phoned Gran on the 10th as it was her birthday, and bought her the obligatory fridge magnet. The next day I did a tour of the town, including the Breakaways, where "Mad Max - Beyond The Thunderdome" was filmed. Another filmset was being constructed, for a sci-fi film called "Pitch Black". Look for it on video.<br><br>

I was back on the bus at half-past midnight, headed for Adelaide. Met Iain again later that day, and we went out to a pub called the "Exeter Hotel" as he needed a drink following some bad news. Good to see a woman behind the decks supplying some funky tunes.<br><br>
