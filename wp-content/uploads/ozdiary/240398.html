<h3><u>Dive, dive, dive!!</U></h3><br>

Woke up this morning to brekkie in bed, courtesy of my sister. I reckon she was just nervous about doing the 12,000ft sky dive today. That's 50 seconds of freefall. She said I could have the stereo if she didn't make it.<br><br>

But she did! Just got back, had a great time, wants to do a course! Sounds wicked! Think I'll give it a miss, though. Haven't got any brown trousers with me!
