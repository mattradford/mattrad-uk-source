<h3><u>Photo Gallery</u></h3><br>

This is a collection of various photos taken on our journey so far, from Sydney, to the north, and also some of Byron Bay. It's divided into eight sections, each with four to six photos in it, so as not to take too long to download (depending on your connection).<br><br>
I hope to put some more on, as soon as I get some developed. But then I have to find a scanner - difficult. One place wanted to charge me AS$260 (about GBP#100) to get thirty photos done! Very cheeky. I hope you've got a decent monitor to get the best out of these...<br>
